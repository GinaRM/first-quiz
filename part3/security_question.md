As the Head of Engineering for our solar panel installation startup, I'm conducting a security audit using the OWASP Top 10 for 2021 as a guide. Here's what I would do to secure our infrastructure:

1. Injection: I'll review our Python backend for potential SQL and NoSQL injection vulnerabilities and ensure we use parameterized queries or an ORM to prevent these attacks.

2. Broken Authentication: I'll verify that our authentication and authorization mechanisms are robust, implementing strong password policies, two-factor authentication, and proper session management. I'll also make sure customer credentials in our MySQL database are securely hashed and encrypted.

3. Sensitive Data Exposure: I'll ensure that sensitive customer data in our MySQL database is encrypted both at rest and in transit. We'll secure our API endpoints and frontend to prevent unauthorized access.

4. XML External Entities (XXE): I'll look for XXE vulnerabilities, particularly if we're parsing XML files, and make sure we disable external entity processing and sanitize XML input.

5. Security Misconfiguration: I'll review our Kubernetes configuration to ensure that default settings don't expose sensitive data. Regular updates and patches for all components, including libraries and frameworks, are essential.

6. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): I'll audit our JavaScript code and web frontend for XSS vulnerabilities, implementing output encoding and sanitization techniques to prevent malicious script injection.

7. Broken Access Control: I'll verify that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive customer data. I'll review and restrict access rights based on roles and employ the principle of least privilege.

8. Security Headers: I'll implement security headers in our web frontend to mitigate various web-based attacks. Utilizing Content Security Policy (CSP) headers will reduce XSS risks.

9. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): I'll protect our app against CSRF attacks by implementing anti-CSRF tokens and validating all state-changing requests on the server side.

10. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities: Regular updates and patches for all components and libraries used in our app are a priority. We'll monitor for security alerts and vulnerabilities in third-party packages.

11. API Security: I'll review and secure our API endpoints, especially in the FastAPI backend. Proper authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and input validation will be implemented to prevent abuse and attacks.

12. Insufficient Logging & Monitoring: I'll set up comprehensive logging and monitoring for our entire infrastructure. This will allow us to detect and respond to security incidents in real-time and retain logs securely for forensic analysis.

Regarding team roles and access, I'll ensure that employees have the least privilege necessary for their job duties. We'll conduct regular security training and perform assessments, penetration testing, and code reviews to identify and remediate security issues.

I'll consider adopting a DevSecOps approach to integrate security into our development process from the outset. This way, security isn't an afterthought but an integral part of our software development lifecycle.
